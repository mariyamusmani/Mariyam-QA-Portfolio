# üß© eOffice Portal ‚Äì Government Office Automation System (Manual Testing)

## üìò Project Overview
This repository contains my **manual testing** work for the eOffice Portal (https://services.eoffice.gov.in) ‚Äî a government office automation system developed by NIC for digital file/workflow management.

The objective of this project was to validate **workflow correctness, document upload/download, form validation, role-based access, and UI/UX consistency** across devices and browsers.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Verify file creation, forwarding, and note-sheet workflows operate as designed
- Validate document upload/download integrity and file preview behavior
- Test authentication, role-based access control, and permissions
- Check UI consistency and responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Document defects with clear steps, screenshots, severity, and recommendations

---

## üß© Scope of Testing
- Functional Testing (workflows, authentication, search, notifications)  
- Regression Testing (post-fix verification)  
- UI/UX Validation (alignment, labels, form behavior)  
- Cross-Browser & Device Compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge; Desktop, Mobile)  
- Accessibility checks (basic WCAG items: tab order, alt text, form labels)

**Modules Tested (examples):**
- Login & Authentication  
- Dashboard & Inbox  
- File Creation & Note Sheet Workflow  
- Document Upload / Download / Preview  
- User Roles & Permissions (Officer, Clerk, Admin)  
- Search, Filters & Advanced Search  
- Notifications & Audit Trail / History  
- Settings & User Profile

## üß† Key Findings & Recommendations (summary)
- Critical: Role-based access checks must be hardened (several permission leaks observed).  
- Major: Document preview reliability ‚Äî some PDF types fail to preview; add server-side validation.  
- UX: Add clearer confirmation and success messages for file forwarding and note-sheet saves.  
- Accessibility: Ensure form labels and tab order follow WCAG basics.  
- Regression: Implement test automation for core workflows to avoid regressions.
